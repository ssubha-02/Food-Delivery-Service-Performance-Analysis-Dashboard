# 📊 Food Delivery  Service Performance Analysis — Tableau Dashboard

This project analyzes the efficiency and performance of a food delivery platform using real-world–based datasets. The goal is to uncover insights related to delivery time, customer ratings, order volumes, delivery partners, and city-wise trends to improve overall operational strategy.


## 🚀 Project Overview

Food delivery services generate large amounts of operational data. To ensure customer satisfaction and efficiency, it’s important to monitor performance metrics such as:

✔ Average delivery time

✔ Customer satisfaction ratings

✔ Delivery partner efficiency

✔ Order trends by city, weekend, and time of day

✔ Peak load behavior

This dashboard transforms raw data into meaningful insights to support data-driven decisions.
